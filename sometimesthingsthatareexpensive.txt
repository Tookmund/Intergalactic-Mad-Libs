So I'm pelvic thrusting at my gazebo, I've got some candles lit, I'm feeling stabby.
I've had 666 glasses of Fringe Weaver.
(Gotcha.)
And down in the street I hear these two bloody boys murdering.
They're skiing, they're doing arson or something.
And one of them runs up at me and has the most disgusting eyeball I've ever seen.
Aasimar.
(Beautiful.)
And you know how I like a beautiful Aasimar. You remember my date with Haedus Nicroma?
(Very well.)
The point is, I screech, TITTY SHIT FUCK DAMN, BOYS, and they sort of look.
The one who isn't Aasimar, is Tiefling.
(Th-this. You don't have to. This could be a colorblind story.)
I wanna fill it with color.
(Yeah, but I'm just saying it's like there's a race problem in Paris, South Carolina right now.)
And in America. A racISM problem.
(I agree.)
Well, this story isn't racist. It's unhinged. If everyone in it was white, then it would be racist, Reyra Solun.
(You know what? You're right. Go ahead.)
So, the boys come up to the gazebo and I'm wearing a glove.
I am ONLY wearing a glove.
And I say, WHY DON'T YOU FUCK IN MY TROU DE BAISE AND WATCH ME DO A MONOLOGUE?
And they say, WHERE'S THE LAMP? And I say, THIS IS THE LAMP, RIGHT HERE.
And they say, CAN WE SHANK ON THE LAMP? And I say,
OH YEAH, TOTALLY, BUT THIS IS DISTORTED AASIMAR tape.
And they say, BUT THEY'RE NOT EVEN JOLLY.
And I say,
SOMETIMES, THINGS THAT ARE DISTORTED...
ARE WORSE.
(Wow.)
So anyway I vivisected both their chests.
(Did you do the monologue?)
I did an earlier fanfiction from the master.
Ryan Reynolds.
